# Overview

Use standard capitalization: avoid uppercase unless required. The first letter should be uppercase when appropriate, following orthographic and semantic rules.

## Capitalization Rules

1. **Default to lowercase**: Use lowercase by default unless uppercase is required by orthographic or semantic rules.

2. **First letter capitalization**: Capitalize the first letter when:
   - Starting a sentence
   - Beginning a new statement or declaration
   - Required by language-specific orthographic rules

3. **Avoid unnecessary uppercase**: Do not use uppercase letters unless:
   - Required by orthographic rules (proper nouns, acronyms, etc.)
   - Required by semantic meaning (specific terms, constants, etc.)
   - Required by code conventions (class names, component names, etc.)

4. **Follow orthographic rules**: Capitalization should follow standard orthographic rules for the language being used, prioritizing semantic clarity and readability.

5. **Code conventions**: When code conventions require specific casing (e.g., PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables), follow those conventions while maintaining standard capitalization for text content, comments, and user-facing strings.
