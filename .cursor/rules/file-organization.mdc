# Overview

All files and components must be organized following a clear and consistent folder structure. Components should be grouped by functional category in dedicated folders.

## Organization Rules

### Component Structure

1. **Basic UI components**: Must be in `components/ui/` and be generic, reusable components (e.g., `button.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `card.tsx`).

2. **Feature components**: Must be in `components/features/{feature-name}/` where `{feature-name}` is the functionality name (e.g., `dashboard`, `auth`, `membership`, `settings`).

3. **Categorization within Features**: When a feature has multiple related components that form a functional category, they should be organized in subfolders. Subfolders can:
   - Use descriptive names for functional categories (e.g., `breadcrumb/`, `sidebar/`, `password/`)
   - Use the same name as the feature when grouping core feature components (e.g., `membership/membership/`, `settings/settings/`)

4. **File names**: 
   - Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx`, `login-form.tsx`, `membership-info.tsx`)
   - Names must be descriptive and reflect the component's functionality
   - Avoid generic names like `component.tsx` or `index.tsx` when there are multiple components in the same folder

5. **Component names**:
   - Use PascalCase for exported component names
   - The component name must match its purpose and context (e.g., `DashboardBreadcrumb`, `LoginForm`, `MembershipInfo`)

### When to create a new folder

- When there are 2 or more related components that form a functional category
- When a component has sub-components or related files (hooks, utils, types)
- When the functionality is complex enough to justify its own folder
- When grouping core feature components under a subfolder with the feature name

### When NOT to create a new folder

- When there's only one file in the folder and no more are expected to be added

## Current Project Structure

```
components/
  ui/
    button.tsx
    input.tsx
    card.tsx
    ...
  features/
    dashboard/
      breadcrumb/
        dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx
      sidebar/
        app-sidebar.tsx
        nav-main.tsx
        nav-projects.tsx
        nav-secondary.tsx
        nav-user.tsx
      transitions/
        page-transition.tsx
    membership/
      membership/
        membership-alert.tsx
        membership-info.tsx
        subscription-status-badge.tsx
      plans/
        plan-card.tsx
        plan-selector.tsx
        upgrade-prompt.tsx
    auth/
      login/
        login-form.tsx
      password/
        forgot-password-form.tsx
        reset-password-form.tsx
      permissions/
        role-guard.tsx
        with-permissions.tsx
      register/
        register-form.tsx
      verification/
        verify-email-form.tsx
    settings/
      settings/
        settings-page.tsx
```

## Correct Examples

```
components/
  features/
    dashboard/
      breadcrumb/
        dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx
      sidebar/
        app-sidebar.tsx
        nav-main.tsx
        nav-user.tsx
    membership/
      membership/
        membership-info.tsx
        membership-alert.tsx
      plans/
        plan-selector.tsx
        plan-card.tsx
    auth/
      login/
        login-form.tsx
      password/
        reset-password-form.tsx
```

## Incorrect Examples

```
components/
  features/
    dashboard/
      sidebar-breadcrumb.tsx  ❌ Should be in breadcrumb/
      dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx  ❌ Should be in breadcrumb/
      component.tsx  ❌ Generic name
    membership/
      membership-info.tsx  ❌ Should be in membership/ subfolder if there are multiple membership components
```
