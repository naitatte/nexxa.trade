# Overview

All files and components must be organized following a clear and consistent folder structure. Components should be grouped by functional category in dedicated folders.

## Organization Rules

### Component Structure

1. **Basic UI components**: Must be in `components/ui/` and be generic, reusable components.

2. **Feature components**: Must be in `components/features/{feature-name}/` where `{feature-name}` is the functionality name (e.g., `dashboard`, `auth`).

3. **Categorization within Features**: When a feature has multiple related components that form a functional category, they should be organized in subfolders:
   - Example: `components/features/dashboard/breadcrumb/` for breadcrumb components
   - Example: `components/features/dashboard/sidebar/` for sidebar components
   - Example: `components/features/dashboard/navigation/` for navigation components

4. **File names**: 
   - Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx`)
   - Names must be descriptive and reflect the component's functionality
   - Avoid generic names like `component.tsx` or `index.tsx` when there are multiple components in the same folder

5. **Component names**:
   - Use PascalCase for exported component names
   - The component name must match its purpose and context (e.g., `DashboardBreadcrumb` instead of `SidebarBreadcrumb` if it's dashboard-specific)

### When to create a new folder

- When there are 2 or more related components that form a functional category
- When a component has sub-components or related files (hooks, utils, types)
- When the functionality is complex enough to justify its own folder

### When NOT to create a new folder

- When there's only one file in the folder and no more are expected to be added

## Correct Examples

```
components/
  features/
    dashboard/
      breadcrumb/
        dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx
      sidebar/
        app-sidebar.tsx
        nav-main.tsx
        nav-user.tsx
      navigation/
        top-nav.tsx
        mobile-nav.tsx
```

## Incorrect Examples

```
components/
  features/
    dashboard/
      sidebar-breadcrumb.tsx  ❌ Should be in breadcrumb/
      dashboard-breadcrumb.tsx  ❌ Should be in breadcrumb/
      component.tsx  ❌ Generic name
```
